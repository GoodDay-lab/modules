# Intro

This is my pet-project. There's I publish some beginning drivers for linux kernel.
Most source I used from LLD3 (you can google it) and source of linux-6.0.

# Big thanks

Most code was written using book "Linux Device Drivers" 3rd edition.
A lot thanks to authors and **O`Reilly** and **"Питер"**.
